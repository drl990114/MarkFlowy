## Feature

- **Super lightweight**. linebyline is based on tauri, which ensures ultra-lightweight and fast performance experience.
- **High availability**. linebyline uses the remirror editor, which not only provides high scalability, but also has a great editing experience. And, linebyline supports multiple editing modes, such as dual, wysiyg.

## Contribute
