Currently supports one-click export of conversations, making chatgpt your smart assistant.\n- **Super lightweight**. The MarkFlowy is based on tauri and has a volume of less than 10MB and better performance.\n- **High availability**. MarkFlowy uses the remirror editor, which not only provides high scalability, but also has a great editing experience. And, MarkFlowy supports multiple editing modes, such as `source code`, `wysiyg`.\n\n## Download\n\nAvailable for Linux, macOS and Windows.\n\nPlease look [releases page](https://github.com/drl990114/MarkFlowy/releases)\n\n## Why\nAt present, I have used many Markdown applications, but I have not encountered one that is very suitable for me. I have always hoped to have a Markdown editor that is efficient, beautiful, lightweight, data-safe, and can be easily combined with various workflows. This It is also the original intention of doing MarkFlowy.\n\n## Contribute\n\nThe current MarkFlowy is still in its infancy, and there may be some bad experiences or bugs, for which I am sorry.
