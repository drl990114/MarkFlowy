## ⚠️ LineByLine is in Alpha

Currently, LineByLine is still in the alpha phase, and it is recommended to use it when there is data backup available.

## Feature

- **Built-in ChatGpt**. Currently supports one-click export of conversations, making chatgpt your smart assistant.
- **Super lightweight**. The linebyline is based on tauri and has a volume of less than 10MB and better performance.
- **High availability**. linebyline uses the remirror editor, which not only provides high scalability, but also has a great editing experience. And, linebyline supports multiple editing modes, such as `source code`, `wysiyg`.

## Why
At present, I have used many Markdown applications, but I have not encountered one that is very suitable for me. I have always hoped to have a Markdown editor that is efficient, beautiful, lightweight, data-safe, and can be easily combined with various workflows. This It is also the original intention of doing linebyline.
