# MarkFlowy

## MarkFlowy is in Alpha

- **Super lightweight**. The MarkFlowy is based on tauri and has a volume of less than 10MB and better performance.

## Why
At present, I have used many Markdown applications, but I have not encountered one that is very suitable for me. I have always hoped to have a Markdown editor that is efficient, beautiful, lightweight, data-safe, and can be easily combined with various workflows. This It is also the original intention of doing MarkFlowy.
